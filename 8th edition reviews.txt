Almost instantly got the ebook and was able to start my homework.
This book is amazing. They cover (condensed) subject matter from a three-course sequence in calculus. Whether you're looking to find the radius of the osculating circle, integrating over a surface, or just wondering what the derivative of e^x is, this book is for you. 'Twas a wondrous read indeed.
The product is available at a good price and it has all the relevant material I need.
