Even though I purchased a used book, but the book had a book cover and the book is as good as a new book, and the price was so much better comparing to Amazon, Textbook Rush.....etc. It was arrived timely.Read full review...
This math textbooks is very comprehensive and relatively easy to understand. I needed it for my Calculus I class, and will continue to use it for the next two years.
This text has college level problems with few errors.  It could be more helpful with larger fonts instead of too much open space.
Great copy of Stewart's textbook. Very little writing and note-taking in it. Mostly pencil. Great value for the awesome textbook.
Covers the content for the class. Good explanation of the concepts.
Great for class! 
Great buy!
Just as expected!
thanks
It's a good version, and I just have to have a Flash Driver to carry on. I hope many people could benefit of this advantage.The book itself is useful, very big with much information about calculus.Read full review...

I needed this for my Calculus I class and so far it is working out for me well. It is a big book, but it has what I am learning in class in it with decent exaamples of the material.
Great textbook for the graduate student. Great example problems throughout the entire book. Some of the solutions are in the back of the book as well.
My book was like almost brand new. There are a few exercises and questions that are different than normal version but I think it is worth to get calc book this cheap.
good thing about this book is that it has lots of helpful examples and hardcover binding which can prevent the pages from coming out
Needed the book for calculus classes and was certainly needed in assisting me in being successful in passing.
